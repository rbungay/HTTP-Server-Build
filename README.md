# Custom HTTP Server Implementation

A robust HTTP/1.1 server implementation in Python that supports multiple client connections, file operations, and response compression. This server demonstrates modern HTTP functionality while maintaining clean, type-safe code through comprehensive type hinting.

## Features

### Core HTTP Functionality
- **HTTP/1.1 Protocol Support**: Full implementation of HTTP/1.1 request handling
- **Multi-threading**: Handles multiple concurrent client connections efficiently
- **Method Support**: Implements GET and POST methods with proper status codes
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes (404, 405, 500)

### Advanced Features
- **File Operations**
  - Binary file upload and download support
  - Secure file path handling
  - Automatic Content-Type detection for files
  - Directory-based file storage

- **Response Compression**
  - Gzip compression support
  - Content-Encoding header handling
  - Automatic compression negotiation

- **Special Endpoints**
  - `/` - Root endpoint returning 200 OK
  - `/echo/*` - Echo service returning client-provided content
  - `/user-agent` - Returns client's User-Agent information
  - `/files/*` - File upload and download functionality

### Technical Implementation
- **Type Safety**
  - Comprehensive type hints throughout the codebase
  - Proper handling of binary and text data
  - Clear interface definitions

- **Robust Error Handling**
  - Graceful handling of malformed requests
  - Proper resource cleanup
  - Detailed error logging

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or later
- `pipenv` (recommended for dependency management)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

2. Set up the environment:
```bash
pipenv install
```

3. Run the server:
```bash
python main.py <directory-path>
```
Replace `<directory-path>` with the path where files should be stored.

## Usage Examples

### Basic GET Request
```bash
curl http://localhost:4221/
```

### Echo Service
```bash
curl http://localhost:4221/echo/hello-world
```

### User Agent Information
```bash
curl http://localhost:4221/user-agent
```

### File Operations
Upload a file:
```bash
curl -X POST -d 'content' http://localhost:4221/files/example.txt
```

Download a file:
```bash
curl http://localhost:4221/files/example.txt
```

### Key Components
- **HTTPServer**: Main server class handling connection management
- **Request Processing**: Dedicated methods for GET and POST requests
- **File Operations**: Binary-safe file handling
- **Compression**: Gzip compression support
- **Multi-threading**: Thread-per-client connection model

### Technical Considerations
- Binary data handling for file operations
- Thread safety in concurrent operations
- Content-Type and Content-Length header management
- Proper HTTP response formatting
- Secure file path handling

## Future Enhancements
- Support for additional HTTP methods (PUT, DELETE)
- HTTPS support
- Request rate limiting
- Cache control implementation
- Enhanced logging capabilities
